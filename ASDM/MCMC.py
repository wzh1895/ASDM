    Calculate the partial derivatives of a function at a set of values. The
    derivatives are calculated using the central difference, using an iterative
    method to check that the values converge as step size decreases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vals: array_like
        A set of values, that are passed to a function, at which to calculate
        the gradient of that function
    func:
        A function that takes in an array of values.
    releps: float, array_like, 1e-3
        The initial relative step size for calculating the derivative.
    abseps: float, array_like, None
        The initial absolute step size for calculating the derivative.
        This overrides `releps` if set.
        `releps` is set then that is used.
    mineps: float, 1e-9
        The minimum relative step size at which to stop iterations if no
        convergence is achieved.
    epsscale: float, 0.5
        The factor by which releps if scaled in each iteration.
